To get this to work, you'll need at least one contact in the simulator. Give them at least a first name and an email address.

Run the app, and select a contact. In the console, you should see some lines like:

>>>>>>>> Getting the record id
>>>>>>>> the record id is: 147433984
>>>>>>>> About to get first name
>>>>>>>> Here's the first name: Joe

But what we get is just
>>>>>>>> Getting the record id
>>>>>>>> the record id is: 147433984
>>>>>>>> About to get first name

and then the app quits the simulator
